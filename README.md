# unix-config

## Installation

Clone this repo somewhere, and then run `./make_links`.

## Pre-commit Hook

This repo includes a git pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that blocks commits when likely secrets are detected in staged files.

Enable it once per clone:

```bash
./scripts/install_hooks
```

## Local Secrets And Overrides

This repo intentionally keeps secrets out of tracked files.

- `.zshrc` loads untracked local files if they exist:
  - `~/.zshrc.local`
  - `~/.zshrc.d/*.local.zsh`
  - Example split: `~/.zshrc.d/mozi.local.zsh` and `~/.zshrc.d/mozi.secrets.local.zsh`
Create local files as needed, then customize locally. The `*.local.*` files are ignored by git.

## Git Config Split

- `.gitconfig` includes `~/.gitconfig.local` for all machine-specific and org-specific overrides.
- Keep Mozi-specific settings directly in `~/.gitconfig.local`:

```ini
[user]
    name = Julian Lo
    email = julian@mozi.app
```

- `~/.gitconfig.local` can also use conditional includes when needed.
